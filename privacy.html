    <h2>1. Introduction & General Overview</h2>
    <p>We, at 24Dismil.com ("Company", "we", "us", "our") and our affiliated companies, are deeply committed to
      respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally
      identifiable information ("Personal Data") you share with us. This comprehensive Privacy Policy (“Policy”) governs
      our website, mobile applications, and sub-domains available under the 24Dismil.com ecosystem (collectively, the
      “Platform”).</p>
    <p>This Policy describes in exhaustive detail how Info Edge India Limited (in this context operating as
      24Dismil.com) collects, uses, processes, discloses and transfers personal data of users while browsing the
      Platform or availing specific real estate services, advertising services, or other products therein (the
      “Services”).</p>
    <p>By providing your explicit consent to this Policy, either directly on the Platform by checking a box, clicking "I
      Agree", or through other means, or by simply accessing the Platform and Services, you unconditionally consent to
      the Company’s processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Policy. Where required by applicable data
      protection laws, for processing your Personal Data for distinct purposes, we seek your consent separately.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>2. Exhaustive List of Personal Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We systematically collect various typologies of Personal Data about you when you access our Platform or Services.
      This data collection spans multiple dimensions to ensure seamless service delivery:</p>
    <h3>A. Information you voluntarily provide to us:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Identifying Details:</strong> This includes your full legal name, permanent and temporary
        addresses, primary and secondary e-mail addresses, primary mobile phone numbers, landline numbers, and login
        credentials including usernames and heavily hashed passwords.</li>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive Property Details:</strong> If you are an owner, builder, or dealer listing a property,
        this includes exhaustive details of the property: nature of the property (commercial, residential, agricultural,
        industrial), pinpoint location details (GPS coordinates, plot numbers, survey numbers), property profile (carpet
        area, built-up area, super built-up area, dimensions, road connectivity, facing direction), high-resolution
        photographs, videos, floor plans, pricing details, tax details, and an exhaustive list of amenities provided.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Strict Identification Documents (KYC):</strong> Information that helps us identify and verify your
        legal identity or your property’s legal standing. This includes scanned copies or numbers of government IDs
        (such as Aadhaar, Voter ID, Driver’s License, PAN Card, Passport) and property documents (utility bills, sales
        deeds, property registration documents, occupancy certificates, property tax receipts).</li>
      <li><strong>Financial & Payment Interactions:</strong> We utilize PCI-DSS compliant third-party payment service
        providers (like Razorpay, Stripe, or BillDesk) to process your payments for premium listings or subscriptions.
        You will be re-directed to a third-party interface. While we do not store core financial data like raw credit
        card numbers or UPI PINs on our servers, we do collect and store transactional metadata, invoice numbers,
        payment status, subscription tiers, and billing addresses.</li>
      <li><strong>Extensive Communication Records:</strong> Absolute records of all your interactions with our customer
        success teams. This includes audio recordings of support calls (for quality and training), chat logs, emails,
        SMS records, physical mail correspondence, feedback forms, survey responses, and dispute resolution artifacts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information we collect automatically when you use our Platforms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Granular Usage Data:</strong> Deep behavioral data collected when you access the Platform. This
        includes your specific search queries, filters applied (price range, BHKs, localities), properties shortlisted,
        properties viewed, times at which you access the Platforms, duration of sessions, heatmap data on where you
        click, and complex inferences of your real estate intent based on algorithmic analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware & Technical Specifications:</strong> Data about the precise devices, software, and technology
        you use. This covers hardware models, operating system versions, IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), preferred
        languages, unique device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address), advertising identifiers (IDFA, GAID), network data
        (carrier, connection type), and granular web browser details.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Tracking Data:</strong> Both general location data (city, region, country inferred from IP)
        and precise GPS location data (if you grant the mobile app permission to access your device's location services
        to show properties "near me").</li>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive Cookie & Beacon Data:</strong> We use an array of cookies (session, persistent, strictly
        necessary, performance, functional, and targeting cookies) and similar technologies (web beacons, clear GIFs,
        pixel tags, log files) to recognize your device across sessions, remember your preferences, and track your
        interaction with our email campaigns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Information we receive from federated third-party sources:</h3>
    <p>We regularly augment our datasets with information from external sources. This includes data from advertising
      networks, marketing partners, data brokers, and public government registries (like RERA portals). Furthermore,
      when you use a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider (like Google, Facebook, or Apple) to log in to our Platform, we
      receive securely transmitted data including your authenticated name, verified email, public profile picture, and
      access tokens.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>3. Extensive Utilization & Processing of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The Platform processes your enormous volume of Personal Data for an exhaustive list of operational, commercial,
      and legal purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Provision of Services:</strong> To create, maintain, and authenticate your account. To process
        your listings, ensure they are visible to the right demographic, and facilitate the core matching engine between
        buyers and sellers.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Algorithmic Recommendations:</strong> Utilizing machine learning frameworks on your Usage
        Data to provide hyper-personalized search results, predicting your willingness to buy, and recommending
        properties that mathematically align with your historical browsing behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Facilitating Direct Connections:</strong> Acting as the conduit for establishing connectivity between
        you and other registered members of the Platform (such as buyers, verified builders, banks, NBFCs, banking
        agents, and independent brokers). This involves sharing your contact variables (like phone numbers) with parties
        you express interest in.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggressive Marketing & Promotional Activities:</strong> To deploy targeted marketing campaigns across
        multiple channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Push Notifications, Retargeting Ads on Google/Meta). We use your data
        to notify you of heavy discounts, new premium projects, or third-party real estate financing offers.</li>
      <li><strong>Rigorous Fraud Prevention & User Verification:</strong> We deploy advanced heuristics and Personal
        Data analysis for identifying suspicious user behavior, detecting fake property listings, preventing account
        takeovers, ensuring robust network security, and investigating financial crimes on the Platform. This includes
        cross-referencing your KYC documents with government databases where legally permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics & Big Data Operations:</strong> Aggregating your data with millions of other users to build
        macro-economic profiles of real estate trends, price indexes, and demographic shifts, which the Company may use
        internally or publish as anonymized market research reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Absolute Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply strictly with any legal obligations, regulatory mandates
        (like RERA guidelines, Information Technology Act 2000), and to establish, exercise, or forcefully defend our
        legal rights in connection with any prospective or ongoing legal proceedings.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>4. Exhaustive Disclosure and Sharing of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>While we consider your privacy paramount, the nature of a real estate marketplace inherently requires the sharing
      of data. We may disclose Personal Data under the following exhaustive scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With the Open Marketplace (Other Users):</strong> When you post a property or express interest in one,
        your core contact details (Name, Phone Number, Email) and property details become accessible to the
        counter-party (buyers, renters, owners, brokers) to facilitate the transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>With specialized Service Providers & Vendors:</strong> The Company aggressively utilizes third-party
        infrastructure. We share data (overriding NDNC registration where applicable) with cloud hosting providers
        (e.g., AWS, GCP), SMS gateways (e.g., Twilio, Gupshup), email service providers (e.g., SendGrid), payment
        processors, KYC verification agencies, customer support software (e.g., Zendesk), and field verification agents
        who physically visit properties.</li>
      <li><strong>Banking and Financial Partners:</strong> Based on your explicit expression of interest regarding home
        loans or financing, we will share your deep financial and personal profile with participating banks, Non-Banking
        Financial Companies (NBFCs), and their immediate agents so they may contact you directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporate Restructuring & Mergers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, corporate
        re-organization, amalgamation, bankruptcy, or sale of substantial assets, your enormous trove of Personal Data
        will be transferred to the acquiring entity as a core business asset.</li>
      <li><strong>Law Enforcement & Government Authorities:</strong> We will share personal data without hesitation when
        legally mandated by subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or explicit requests by local, state, or federal law
        enforcement to assist in investigations regarding cybercrime, fraud, or national security.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>5. Stringent Storage, Security, and Protection Protocols</h2>
    <p>Our Company is headquartered in India, and the vast majority of our server infrastructure is securely located
      within Indian territory to comply with data localization norms. However, via our global cloud providers, data may
      be mirrored, transferred, or processed in other jurisdictions globally for redundancy.</p>
    <p>The security and absolute confidentiality of your personal data is a top corporate priority. We have invested
      massive capital into enterprise-grade security architectures. This includes AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3
      encryption in transit, strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for our employees, mandatory Multi-Factor
      Authentication (MFA) for administrative access, regular third-party penetration testing, and continuous
      vulnerability scanning of our web architecture.</p>
    <p>Despite our exhaustive safeguards, no transmission of data over the public Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure. You provide your Personal Data to the Platform at your own absolute risk.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>6. Infinite Retention and Archival of Data</h2>
    <p>Your personal data is processed and actively retained to enable your seamless access to the Platform. We will
      aggressively keep your Personal Data as long as it is necessary to provide you Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Crucially:</strong> To ensure unshakeable compliance with applicable laws, to maintain accurate
      accounting/tax records, for severe fraud prevention, and for evidence in multi-year legal proceedings, we may
      retain your core contact information, transaction history, and KYC documents indefinitely—even after you have
      forcefully requested account deletion or terminated your relationship with the Platform. Post termination, we will
      continue to freely utilize endlessly aggregated, anonymized versions of your data for any commercial purpose.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>7. Comprehensive User Rights & Opt-Out Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Subject to the constraints of local law, you possess rights over your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access and Rectification:</strong> You have the right to access, verify, entirely correct, complete,
        or update your explicit profile details via your dashboard settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent Withdrawal:</strong> You may formally withdraw your consent for future data processing
        operations by emailing our grievance desk. However, the Company reserves the absolute right to immediately
        terminate your access to the Platform if such data is deemed essential for core service provision.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Opt-Outs:</strong> We (and our thousands of broker partners) will communicate with you
        heavily via voice calls, SMS, WhatsApp, and Emails. You may forcefully opt-out of promotional marketing by
        clicking the "Unsubscribe" links in our emails or writing to us. However, critical transactional SMS/Emails
        cannot be opted out of.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>8. Disclaimer Regarding Third-Party Ecosystems</h2>
    <p>The Platform is deeply integrated with and contains hundreds of links to massive third-party websites, apps, real
      estate aggregator services, ad networks, and banking portals. This Privacy Policy categorically <strong>does not
        apply</strong> to the collection, tracking, use, or sinister sharing practices of those third parties. Data
      consumed by third parties is subject entirely to their own, separate privacy policies (such as Google's Privacy
      Policy). We absolutely absolve ourselves of any and all liability for the privacy breaches or tracking behaviors
      of linked third-party environments.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>9. Strict Policy Regarding Minors</h2>
    <p>The Platform is an adult commercial environment. It is categorically, legally, and functionally not intended for
      use by children under 18 years of age. Any use of the Platform by a minor must occur strictly under verified
      parental supervision. We do not knowingly harvest information from minors. If we detect an account belonging to a
      minor, we will execute immediate deletion procedures.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>10. Unilateral Right to Modification</h2>
    <p>The Company reserves the unilateral, unchallengeable right to completely overhaul, update, completely change, or
      rewrite this exhaustive Privacy Policy at any time, with or without prior direct notice to you. The completely
      updated Policy shall instantly come into effect from the exact millisecond of its publication on the Platform URL.
      Your continued use of the website following a silent update signifies absolute legal acceptance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>11. Dedicated Grievance Redressal Mechanism</h2>
    <p>Pursuant to the Information Technology Act 2000 and rules made thereunder, questions, deep concerns, or
      aggressive legal complaints related to the processing of your Personal Data must be directed to the officially
      appointed Grievance Officer.</p>
