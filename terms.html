    <h2>1. Unconditional Acceptance of Master Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, accessing, browsing, or using 24Dismil.com, its mobile applications, APIs, secondary portals, or
      any affiliated services (collectively, the "Platform"), you unequivocally accept and agree to be bound by these
      exhaustive Master Terms & Conditions ("Terms"). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you
      (the "User", "Advertiser", "Buyer", "Broker") and Info Edge India Limited (operating as 24Dismil.com). If you do
      not agree with any fraction of these Terms, you are prohibited from utilizing our Platform.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>2. Definition and Strictly Limited Provision of Services</h2>
    <p>24Dismil.com operates strictly as an intermediary, online real estate aggregator, and advertising platform. We
      allow users to list, search, view, and heavily market properties for sale or rent. <strong>Under no circumstances
        do we act as a licensed real estate agent, broker, property manager, legal advisor, or fiduciary for you or any
        other user.</strong></p>
    <p>We are absolutely not a party to, nor are we responsible for, any subsequent transaction, negotiation, lease
      agreement, sale deed, or financial transfer that occurs between property buyers, sellers, landlords, and tenants.
      All agreements are solely between the engaging parties. You are strongly advised to perform independent legal and
      physical due diligence before finalizing any real estate transaction triggered via this Platform.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>3. Exhaustive Rules for Submission and Administration of Listings</h2>
    <p>Users who utilize our Platform to post property listings, projects, or advertisements are strictly governed by
      the following unyielding rules. Violation of these rules will result in immediate termination of the listing
      without refund, and potential legal action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Absolute Accuracy Protocol:</strong> You must ensure that every detail, dimension, legal status,
        encumbrance status, specific location (down to the block/plot), and provided photograph of the property is 100%
        accurate, fiercely current, and provably true. Uploading deceptive stock photos or misleading dimensions is
        strictly prohibited.</li>
      <li><strong>Mandatory Legal Authorization:</strong> You must possess the absolute legal right, clear title, or
        explicit, written Power of Attorney from the actual owner to list the property. Brokers must be explicitly
        authorized by the property titleholder.</li>
      <li><strong>Strict Non-Discrimination Policy:</strong> Usage of 24Dismil.com to upload content that explicitly or
        implicitly enables targeting or exclusion based on religion, community, caste, race, gender, marital status, or
        dietary preferences is aggressively prohibited and constitutes grounds for immediate lifetime account bans.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardized Measurements:</strong> All listings must provide areas in legally recognized, standard
        metric units (e.g., Square Feet, Square Meters, Acres). Listings using hyper-local unverified units without
        standard conversion may be suspended.</li>
      <li><strong>Unilateral Modification & Removal Rights:</strong> The Company reserves the absolute, unchallengeable
        right to verify, heavily edit, pause, watermark, or permanently delete any listing that violates our evolving
        terms, attracts excessive user complaints, triggers our automated fraud-detection heuristics, or is reasonably
        suspected to be fraudulent, entirely without prior notice or compensation.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>4. User Account, Authentication, and Absolute Security Protocols</h2>
    <p>To access the core utility of the Platform, you must register for an account using verified single sign-on
      providers (like Google Authentication) or via OTP-verified mobile numbers. You are entirely responsible for
      maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account tokens, session data, and underlying credentials.
      24Dismil.com takes zero responsibility for any data breach, unauthorized listing modification, or financial loss
      resulting from your local device compromise, weak passwords, or user negligence.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>5. Exhaustive Payment Terms and Zero-Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Certain high-tier premium services (such as "Featured Listings", "Builder Spotlights", "Lead Generation
      Packages") require upfront payment. By selecting a premium service, you irrevocably agree to pay the fees
      indicated inclusive of all applicable taxes (such as GST). <strong>All successful payments remitted to
        24Dismil.com are absolutely, non-negotiably non-refundable</strong> unless explicitly mandated by court order or
      due to a verified catastrophic technical failure on our immediate servers. We do not provide prorated refunds for
      canceled subscriptions midway through a billing cycle.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>6. Severe Constraints on Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>Every single byte of content included on the Platform—including but not limited to raw text, high-resolution
      graphics, corporate logos, UI images, audio clips, digital downloads, complex data compilations, proprietary
      matching algorithms, and backend software—is the exclusive, undisputed property of 24Dismil.com or its licensed
      content suppliers and is fiercely protected by Indian and International copyright statutes.</p>
    <p>You may not systematically extract, re-utilize, data-mine, or reverse engineer any part of the Platform’s content
      without our express, written, legally notarized corporate consent.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>7. Aggressively Prohibited Usage and Network Abuse</h2>
    <p>You explicitly agree and geographically bind yourself not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deploy, execute, or permit any automated system, including "robots," "spiders," "scrapers," "sniffers," or
        "offline readers," to access, read, or download data from the Platform at a speed exceeding human capability.
      </li>
      <li>Systematically collect, harvest, or scrape any personally identifiable information, including agent contact
        numbers, user emails, or broker directories, for the purpose of creating derivative competing databases.</li>
      <li>Use the Platform's messaging or contact infrastructure for any commercial solicitation purposes outside the
        immediate scope of finalizing the specifically listed real estate transaction. Spamming users with unrelated
        offers is forbidden.</li>
      <li>Transmit or inject any viruses, zero-day exploits, SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, Trojan
        horses, or any code of a destructive or disruptive nature against our cloud infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>8. Complete Disclaimer of Warranties & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>24Dismil.com provides the platform entirely on an "as is", "with all faults", and "as available"
        basis.</strong> We fundamentally do not guarantee the accuracy, legal standing, encumbrance status, or physical
      existence of any property listings, nor do we guarantee the true identity, financial capability, or intent of any
      users utilizing the platform.</p>
    <p>You agree to use the platform at your own absolute risk. In no event, under any legal theory (tort, contract,
      strict liability, or otherwise), shall 24Dismil.com, its directors, employees, or subsidiaries be liable for any
      direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential massive damages (including loss of profits, loss
      of data, property fraud, or physical harm) arising precisely out of the use, inability to use, or reliance upon
      any information obtained directly or indirectly from the Platform.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>9. Strict Indemnification Clause</h2>
    <p>You agree to heavily defend, indemnify, and hold harmless 24Dismil.com, its corporate affiliates, officers,
      directors, employees, and cloud agents, from and against any and all claims, severe damages, monetary obligations,
      losses, immense liabilities, legal costs, and attorney's fees arising from: (i) your usage of and access to the
      Platform; (ii) your violation of any term of these Master Terms; (iii) your violation of any third party right,
      including without limitation any copyright, property title, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that one of your
      aggressive property listings caused damage to a third party.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>10. Unilateral Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the absolute, unchallengeable right to modify, overhaul, or append these terms from time to time at
      our sole corporate discretion to reflect changing legal jurisprudence or business models. Your continued use of
      the website following any silent changes signifies your irrevocable legal acceptance of the new terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>11. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration & Exclusive Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be exclusively governed by and interpreted strictly in accordance with the substantive laws of
      the Republic of India. Any complex disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to these terms,
      or the breach thereof, shall be first resolved via mandatory binding arbitration in accordance with the
      Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The seat and venue of arbitration, as well as the exclusive jurisdiction
      for any court appeals, shall be situated uniquely in the courts located within <strong>Delhi NCR, India</strong>.
